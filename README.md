Module 14 Challenge of the BCS Boot Camp: Using JavaScript, D3, and HTML to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.

All code is my own. I used Xpert Learning Assistant, Stack Overflow, and course resources to research, identify, test, and confirm concepts.

The apps.js file has comments that are instructions for how to write the code and complete the assignment.

Based on a quick look at the results, it seems that people who wash their belly button less frequently have fewer bacteria, which seems counterintuitive and requires further analysis.
